Lesson 01 Demo 01

INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING ANSIBLE  



 
 

Click on Launch instances
 

Select AMI as Ubuntu 24.4


 

Click on Create new key pair and create a new key pair
 

 

The key would be downloaded to the machine 

In Firewall , 

 

Change the number of instances to 3 and launch the instances. We will consider one machine as master machine and other two as nodes 
 

After Machines are launched We can rename them as :

 





Step 2:  Now we will connect to these machines 


We can connect to the machine directly via browser 

Select the ansible-server and click on connect
 

Click on Ec2 instance connect tab 

 
Note: Do not change the username 

 

Similarly, We can connect with other machines as well


Step 3: lets now install ansible in ansible server (execute the below command only in master machine) 


sudo su 
 apt update -y
 apt-get install -y software-properties-common
 apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
  apt-get update
  apt-get install -y ansible

 

# ansible --version 

 

 


Step 4:   we will now define the hosts  from the master machine (ansible server) 

vi /etc/ansible/hosts

[ansiblegroup]
Privateip of node1
Privateip of node2




 

Copy the private ip of the node 1

 

 
(we have to also copy the paste the private ip of the node2 as well) 


Step 5: Create a user in Ansible server (master machine) and the nodes

# adduser devops 
(put password as devops)
And press enter three times and press y 

 



Similary create the same username and pass In the nodes as well


Perform same task in node2 as well
(use same username and pass in master and the nodes) 

Step 6: We will now configure sshd configuration in master and node machines 

            # vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
press i
 
On line 34 change to PermitRootlogin yes and remove #
 
Remove # from line 38
 
On line 57 enable PasswordAuthentication as yes by removing #
 

(perform same activity in node1 and node2 as well)

(with latest ubuntu these steps need to be added up in master and nodes) 
#vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf
Change password authentication to yes



 


            # service ssh restart

 

Step 6: We will now give sudo permission to the “devops” user in ansible and the nodes

# visudo 

 

Scroll down to user priviledge specification and add below line 

devops ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

 

Press ctrl x and then press Y and enter

(We need to perform the same activity for node1 and node2)



Step 7: From  Ansible server we will generate the trust relationship(we will generate a key in the master and paste it in the ansible nodes to establish the ssh connection w/o putting password) with the nodes 

In Ansible-server (master machine):

# su – devops
# ssh-keygen 
(above command generate the key in master machine) 
(press enter three times)

 



Now we need to copy the keypair in the node 1 and node2 

Go to Ansible-server(master) 

# ls -a
# cd .ssh
   
 

# ssh-copy-id devops@privateipofnode1

 

In the password put the password which we set while creating the user devops

Similarly copy to the node2 as well

 

We have now established the trust relationship of the master with the nodes.

Step 8: Lets now check if we are able to see the create files in the nodes via ansible
